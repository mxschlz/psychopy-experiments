def permutation_test(group1, group2, n_permutations=10000, plot=True, **kwargs):
    """
    Perform a permutation test to compare two groups.

    Parameters:
    - group1 (pandas Series or numpy array): Data for the first group.
    - group2 (pandas Series or numpy array): Data for the second group.
    - n_permutations (int, optional): Number of permutations to perform (default is 10000).
    - plot (bool, optional): Whether to plot the permutation distribution (default is True).

    Returns:
    - p_value (float): The p-value for the permutation test.

    The permutation test assesses whether the difference between the means of two groups is
    statistically significant by randomly permuting the data and computing the p-value.
