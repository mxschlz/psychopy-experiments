Task design for WP1: Bottom-Up Influences in Distraction.

- think about using a direction interval in which stimuli are presented (one interval per position)
- think about target dimension (distractor dimension is spectral --> different fundamental frequency)
- maybe either use temporal envelope modulation (30 Hz as in pilot experiment) or identity detection (was 5 present or not)
- idea: moving sound source in elevation? german and english
- 250 ms stimuli to make them perceptually more difficult

DESIGN
IV:
5 spatial positions target
5 spatial positions distractor
2 distractor absent/present
