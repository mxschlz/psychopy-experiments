Welcome to the experiment.

You are about to hear single syllable digits from five unique spatial locations. 

In some trials, one sound is the target, whereas all other sounds are distractor stimuli. The target will always be the 
digit 5.The distractors will be random numbers, and one of them differs in frequency. 
Please only focus on the position of the target. If the target appears in a unique location, press the according 
number between 1 and 5. 1 is the leftmost location, 5 is the rightmost location.

Press SPACE to begin.
